\section{Introduction}

\section{Context Description}
This section describes the 
\textbf{Definition:}
Ship lift. General purpose ship lift for elevating ships to a geographically, vertical, higher location. \\
\subsection{General Outline}
\begin{itemize}
	\item no operator - fully autonomous system
	\item only 2 two levels
	\item two gates
	\item two signaling systems, each facing both ways
	\item one valve per gate
	\item unlimited water supply on upper level
	\item Lift is assumed to be big enough for all ships passing through
\end{itemize}
\pagebreak

\subsection{Output}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Signal light: pass or hold
	\item Gates: open or closed
	\item Valves: open or closed
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Input}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Actuator states
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Signal light: pass or hold
		\item Gates: open or closed
		\item Valves: open or closed
	\end{itemize}
	\item Waterflow through valve pipes
	\item Location of the ship in the system
	\begin{itemize}
		\item completely in the lift
		\item at the signal lights
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Only one gate can be open at a time
	\item Only one valve can be open at a time
	\item After a ship has entered the sluice the gate will close
	\item A gate can only close if there is no ship in between its doors
	\item A gate can only open if the water level on both sides is equal
	\item Entering signal light:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The signal must always be on
			\item The signal must never indicate pass and hold at the same time
			\item The signal can only indicate pass if the gate is completely opened
			\item The signal can only indicate pass if there is no ship in the system
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Leaving signal light:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The signal must always be on
			\item The signal must never indicate pass and hold at the same time
			\item The signal can only indicate pass if the gate is completely opened
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
