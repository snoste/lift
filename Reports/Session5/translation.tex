\subsubsection*{Safety}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Only one gate can be open at a time
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It is only possible to send an openGate(gateID$_i$) to open gate $i$ after gateState(gateID$_j$, $ b $) delivers $b = false$ and openGate(gateID$_j$) has not been issued in the meantime, for gateID$_i \neq$ gateID$_j$.
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item Only one valve can be open at a time
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It is only possible to send an openValve(valveID$_i$) to open valve $i$ after \linebreak valveState$_j$($ b $) delivers $b = false$ and openValve(valveID$_j$) has not been issued in the meantime, for valveID$_i \neq$ valveID$_j$.
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item A valve and a gate at different levels can never be open at the same time
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It is only possible to send an openGate(gateID$_i$) to open gate $i$ after valveState$_j$($ b $) delivers $b = false$ and openValve(valveID$_j$) has not been issued in the meantime, for gate $i$ and valve $j$ are on opposite sides of the lift.
			\item It is only possible to send an openValve(valveID$_i$) to open valve $i$ after gateState$_j$($ b $) delivers $b = false$ and openGate(gateID$_j$) has not been issued in the meantime, for valve $i$ and gate $j$ are on opposite sides of the lift.
		\end{itemize}
	
	%\item After a ship has entered the sluice the gate will close
	%\begin{itemize}
	%	\item it is not possible to send closeGate(gate\_ID) if getShipPresence(pos\_(same(ID).1),false)	
	%\end{itemize}
	
	\item A gate can only close if there is no ship in between its doors
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It is only possible to send closeGate(gateID$_i$) to close gate $i$ after gateSensor$_i$($b$) delivers $b = false$ and no other action has been issued in the meantime.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item A gate can only open if the water level on both sides is equal
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It is only possible to send openGate(gateID$_i$) to open gate $i$ after \linebreak compareWaterLevel$_j$($b$) delivers $b = true$ and no other action has been issued in the meantime, for gate $i$ and container $j$ are on the same side of the lift.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Signal lights can never be off nor indicate hold and pass at the same time
		\begin{itemize}
			\item passSignalOn(signalID$_i$) has to be followed directly by \\ haltSignalOff(signalID$_i$).
			\item haltSignalOn(signalID$_i$) has to be followed directly by \\passSignalOff(signalID$_i$).
			\item passSignalOff(signalID$_i$) can only be issued directly after \\haltSignalOn(signalID$_i$).
			\item haltSignalOff(signalID$_i$) can only be issued directly after \\ passSignalOn(signalID$_i$).
		\end{itemize}
	\item Signal lights can only indicate pass if the gate is completely opened
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It is only possible to send passSignalOn(signalID$_i$) to set signal $i$ to pass after a gateState$_j$($ b $) delivers $b = true$ and closeGate(gateID$_j$) has not been issued in the meantime, for signal $i$ and gate $j$ are on the same side of the lift.
		\end{itemize}
	\item An entering signal can only indicate pass if there is no ship in the lift already
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It is only possible to send passSignalOn(signalID$_i$) to set the entering signal $i$ to pass after boatExitUp or boatExitDown and neither goToPos00 or goToPos10 have been issued in the meantime.\vspace{0.3cm}
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Functional}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item After a ship entered the system, this ship should be transported to the other level before any other ship is allowed to enter the system
	\begin{itemize}
		\item After a goToPos01 action, a boatExitUp should be issued and not an goToPos11 action between.
		\item After a goToPos11 action, a boatExitDown should be issued and not an goToPos01 action between.
	\end{itemize}
