\section{Translation of the Requirements into Interaction}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Only one gate can be open at a time
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It is only possible to send an openGate(gate\_ID) if getGateState(gate\_opposite(ID),false).
			\item openGate(gate\_ID) and openGate(gate\_opposite(ID)) cannot be done in parallel.
			
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item Only one valve can be open at a time
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It is only possible to send an openValve(valve\_ID) if getValveState(valve\_opposite(ID),false).
			\item openValve(valve\_ID) and openValve(gate\_opposite(ID)) cannot be done in parallel.
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item A valve and gate at different levels can never be open at the same time
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It is only possible to send an openGate(gate\_ID) if getValveState(valve\_opposite(ID),false).
			\item It is only possible to send an openValve(valve\_ID) if getGateState(gate\_opposite(ID)),false).
			\item openValve(valve\_ID) and openGate(gate\_opposite(ID)) cannot be done in parallel.
		\end{itemize}
	
	%\item After a ship has entered the sluice the gate will close
	%\begin{itemize}
	%	\item it is not possible to send closeGate(gate\_ID) if getShipPresence(pos\_(same(ID).1),false)	
	%\end{itemize}
	
	\item A gate can only close if there is no ship in between its doors
	\begin{itemize}
		\item it is not possible to send closeGate(gate\_ID) if getGateSensor(gate\_same(ID),true)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item A gate can only open if the water level on both sides is equal
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It is not possible to openGate(gate\_ID) if compareWaterlevel(Container\_same(ID),false)

	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Without a ship in the system the system will remain idle
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If getShipPresence(pos\_all(ID), false) it is not possible to send openGate(gate\_all(ID)), it is not possible to send setSignalPass(signal\_all(ID)) and it is not possible to send openValve(valve\_all(ID)) nor closeValve(valve\_all(ID))
		
		
		%\item if the system detect that there are not ship (checking receivedShipPresence\_posID=false for all the 4 position) the system has to close all the door using closeGate\_gateID action an also turn all the signal light to red by the action setSignalHold\-signalID
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\item Entering signal light:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The signal must always be on
			\item The signal must never indicate pass and hold at the same time
			\item The signal can only indicate pass if the gate is completely opened
			\item The signal can only indicate pass if there is no ship in the system
			\item When the system is in idle state all doors must be closed.
			
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Leaving signal light:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The signal must always be on
			\item The signal must never indicate pass and hold at the same time
			\item The signal can only indicate pass if the gate is completely opened
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
