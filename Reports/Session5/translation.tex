\section{Translation of the Requirements into Interaction}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Only one gate can be open at a time	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item An openGate(0) action cannot be followed by an openGate(1) action unless a closeGate(0) action happened in between.
			\item An openGate(1) action cannot be followed by an openGate(0) action unless a closeGate(1) action happened in between.
			
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item Only one valve can be open at a time	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item An openValve(0) action cannot be followed by an openValve(1) action unless a closeValve(0) action happened in between.
			\item An openValve(1) action cannot be followed by an openValve(0) action unless a closeValve(1) action happened in between.
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item A valve and a gate at different levels can never be open at the same time
		\begin{itemize}
			\item An openValve(0) action is not allowed after an openGate(1) action, and visa versa.
			\item An openValve(1) action is not allowed after an openGate(0) action, and visa versa.
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item A gate can only close if there is no ship in between its doors
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A closeGate(gateID) can only be done after gateSensor(gateID, false)
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item A gate can only open if the water level on both sides is equal
		\begin{itemize}
			\item An openGate(1) action can only be done after compareWaterlevel(1.0, true)
			\item An openGate(0) action can only be done after compareWaterlevel(0.0, true)
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item Without a ship in the system the system will go into idle
		\begin{itemize}
			\item if every shipPresence(posID, false) do a haltSignal(signalID, true) for every signalID, a passSignal(signalID, false) for every signalID, followed by a closeGate(0) and closeGate(1) action.
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item Entering signal light:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The signal must always be on
			\item The signal must never indicate pass and hold at the same time
			\item The signal can only indicate pass if the gate is completely opened
			\item The signal can only indicate pass if there is no ship in the system
			\item When the system is in idle state all doors must be closed.
			
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Leaving signal light:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The signal must always be on
			\item The signal must never indicate pass and hold at the same time
			\item The signal can only indicate pass if the gate is completely opened
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
