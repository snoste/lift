	\item A gate can only close if there is no ship in between its doors
	\item A gate can only open if the water level on both sides is equal
	\item Without a ship in the system, the system will go into the idle state:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item All gates are closed
		\item All signals indicate halt
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Entering signal light:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The signal must always be on

	\end{enumerate}
	\item Leaving signal light:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The signal must always be on
		\item The signal must never indicate pass and hold at the same time
		\item The signal can only indicate pass if the gate is completely opened
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
	
\subsubsection*{Functionality}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If the system is in idle the first ship to arrive at a signal light should get served first
	\item If the system is not in idle state, a ship is leaving the system and there
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item is no other boat waiting, the system should enter idle state
		\item are boats waiting on one side of the lift, the first boat in line gets served 
		\item are boats waiting on both sides of the lift, then the first boat on the current level gets served
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
