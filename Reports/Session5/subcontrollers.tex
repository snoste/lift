\section{Sub controllers}
This section aims to derive sub controllers for the boat lift safety control system. The sub controllers communicate with each other and externally through the interactions and signals desribed in the previous section:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Master controller, controls the water flow and water level of the lift
	\item Gate controller, controls the lift gates
	\item Valve controller, controls the lift valves
	\item Signal controller, controls the signal lights
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The functioning of the sub controllers in combination with the actions and signals is displayed in the figure below:

\subsection{Master controller}
The master controller keeps track of the position of the ship inside the system. Its responsible for coordinating the sequence of actions that are executed. These are either to set the gates, valves or signals. It recieves confirmations or error signals back from the other sub controllers to either confirm or refute actions were carried out. \\

\noindent In Table \ref{tab:internal} a list of internal commands which the master controller uses to communicate with other sub controllers is displayed.

\subsection{Gate controller}
The gate controller ensures that all safety requirements are met. It gets a close or open command for the gates from the master controller. It sends a Gateready signal back to the master to confirm a gate has been safely opened or closed. It also makes sure that there is no ship between the doors before and whilst there doors are beeing closed.
\subsection{Valve controller}
The valve controller is responsible for opening and closing the valves, and for setting the water level. It  gets the setWaterlevel command from the master controller to set the waterlevel to be equal to container x.1. It receives the valvestate to know if a valve is either open or closed. It executes the external actions openValve and closeValve to actually open or close a valve.
\subsection{Signal controller}
The signal controller is responsible for tunring on and off the signal lights. It receives a SetSignalPass or SetSignalHaltAll from the master controller. It sends back that the signal has been set with Signalready or Signalerror when this was not accomplished. The signal subcontroller executes the external actions passSignalOn, passSignalOff, HaltSignalOn or HaltSignal off to set the signal lights.
