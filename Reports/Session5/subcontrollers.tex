\section{Sub controllers}
This section will aim to derive sub controllers for the boat lift safety control system. The sub controllers communicate with each other and externally through the interactions and signals desribed in the previous section:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Master controller, controls the water flow and water level of the lift
	\item Gate controller, controls the lift gates
	\item Valve controller, controls the lift valves
	\item Signal controller, controls the signal lights
\end{enumerate}

The functioning of the sub controllers in combination with the actions and signals is displayed in the figure below:
