\section{Preface}
This report describes the modeling of an autonomous boat lift safety control system using the mCRL2 toolset. It is structured similar to the weekly iterations that were issued during the project meetings. Starting with a contextual description and requirements, to modeling the system into mCRL2 with defined actions and signals, and finally verifying the mCRL2 model with modal {\textmu}-calculus formulas translated from the requirements. The mCRL2 code and mcf verification code can be found in Appendix A and Appendix B.
