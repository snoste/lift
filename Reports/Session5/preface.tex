\section{Preface}
This report describes the modeling of an autonomous boat lift safety control system using the mCRL2 toolset. The report starts by giving a contextual description of the boat lift, for which the control system is designed. Then from this context, requirements are derived and interactions are defined which the safety control system will eventually use. Using the defined interactions, the requirements are then translated into terms of the interactions. Furthermore the control system is divided up into multiple subcontrollers. Once all these steps are taken the system is modelled in the mCRL2 simulator. The final step is to then verify if this model satisfies the requirements by translating these into modal {\textmu}-calculus formulas, and run them over the model. The mCRL2 code and mcf verification code can be found in Appendix A and Appendix B.
