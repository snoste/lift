\section{Translation of the Requirements into Interaction}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Only one gate can be open at a time
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It is not possible to send open\_Gategate0 and open\_Gategate1 at the same time
			\item Before open a gate, the system should check if the other gate is open by using requestGateState\_gateID (this ID should be the opposite of the gate that the system is opening)
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item Only one valve can be open at a time
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It is not possible to send openValve\_valve0 and openValve\_valve1 at the same time
			\item Before open a valve, the system should check if the other valve is open by using requestValveState\_valveID (this ID should be the opposite of the valve that the system is opening)
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item A valve and gate at different levels can never be open at the same time
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It is forbidden to send at the same time a open\_GategateID and openValve\_valveID if the ID is different.
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item After a ship has entered the sluice the gate will close
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The door can close by closeGate\_gateID request if receivedShipPresence\_posID of the closest position to the gate to close is equal to true
		
	\end{itemize}
	\item A gate can only close if there is no ship in between its doors
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If, after a requestGateSensor\_gateID it is received a receivedGateSensor\_gateID=false, then it is possible to send a closeGate\_gateID
		
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item A gate can only open if the water level on both sides is equal
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Before open a gate, the system must check if the level of two container adjacent to the gate are equal: first send requestWaterlevel\_containerID to the two adjacent container and than check if the two receivedWaterlevel\_containerID value are the same. The system now can open the gate securely.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Without a ship in the system the system will remain idle
	\begin{itemize}
		\item if the system detect that there are not ship (checking receivedShipPresence\_posID=false for all the 4 position) the system has to close all the door using closeGate\_gateID action an also turn all the signal light to red by the action setSignalHold\-signalID
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\item Entering signal light:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The signal must always be on
			\item The signal must never indicate pass and hold at the same time
			\item The signal can only indicate pass if the gate is completely opened
			\item The signal can only indicate pass if there is no ship in the system
			\item When the system is in idle state all doors must be closed.
			
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Leaving signal light:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The signal must always be on
			\item The signal must never indicate pass and hold at the same time
			\item The signal can only indicate pass if the gate is completely opened
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection*{Functionality}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The system should work with a "first come - first serve" principle
	\item When a ship is waiting at a entry signal light, the light should switch to pass as soon as possible
	\item After a ship has entered the system, the exit signal light on the other side should switch to pass as soon as possible
\end{enumerate}
